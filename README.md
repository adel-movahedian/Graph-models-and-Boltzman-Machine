# Graph models & Secure Multiparty Computation with Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (DRBM)

## Overview
This project implements **secure multiparty computation (SMPC)** using **Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (DRBM)** for privacy-preserving machine learning. The framework enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without exposing their private data.

## Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Utilizes SMPC to ensure data confidentiality.
- **Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (DRBM)**: Implements probabilistic models with sigmoid activation for secure computations.
- **Secure Parameter Updates**: Enhances privacy with encrypted updates.
- **Distributed Data Aggregation**: Enables collaborative learning without data leakage.

## Future Improvements
- Extend to support federated learning.
- Optimize performance with advanced encryption techniques.
- Implement additional deep learning architectures.
